environment assessment

instead of doing spherical shells divided into voxels
define a cubic lattice on AA coordinate space
inscribe a sphere for some radius of interest to discard vertices outside sphere
use fuzzy set function to assign membership of environmental atom to nearest vertices
   can sort atoms in x,y,z for assignment

sort vertices by distance to AA center for input to neural net
   also should make nice presentation in bar graphs - e.g. like convolutional NNs in different atom types

perhaps set up NNs for each dihedral -- at least on side chains, could yield fast evaluation of side chain rotamers for backbone motions

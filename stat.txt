   - Met with Julie Makani regarding plans and desired projects; abstract requested
   - first draft abstract

04 nov 2015
   - abstract submitted to Julie Makani and copied to Keith Dunker
   - get PDB and Pisces mirrors updated on Synology NAS, bounce crond

08 nov 2015
   - expand abstract for Julie to hve background, objectives, methods, anticipated outcomes

09 nov 2015
   - submit abstract 2 to Julie
   - compile dssp on mac - does not do side chains
   - fire still 32 bit, need to reinstall linux - appears 64bit luaJIT ok now

10 nov 2015
   - fire set up as 64 bit
   - installed torch
   - tensorflow released, installed
   
12 nov 2015
   - dssp chi1 implemented but not checked.  based on http://www.zucic.org/garlic/commands/dihedrals.html ( http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/local/programs/garlic/commands/dihedrals.html )

13 nov 2015
   - dssp chi2, chi3, chi4, chi5 implemented
   - checked on 7rsa arg 39, seems ok for 0 degree definitions
   -- next is deciding output format, feed to buildprot
   - got buildprot compiled on mac, new Makefile
   -- backbone only

14 nov 2015
   - lay out data structure ideas atom->angles
   - list some use cases

17 nov 2015
   - read dill paper on kinematic loop closure
   -- suspect main benefit may be description of peptide plane rotation
   
19 nov 2015
   - get disgro paper and software - later than dill, C++
   
20 nov 2015
   - start notes on manipulators and evaluators
   
21 nov 2015
   - more notes on manipulators and evaluators
   
24 nov 2015
   - investigate ballview - bal writes trajectory files but does not appear to visualise?
   - get vmd - reads gromacs trajectory files

27 nov 2011
   - reading about GPUs and convolutional neural networks - http://timdettmers.com/2014/08/14/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/ and others especially on this site

28 nov 2015
   - more in-depth convolutional nets :  http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/ -- focused on images, but description much more amenable to residue environments

29 nov 2015
   - thinking about outputs as classification, e.g. 20 aas for c-alpha, specific side chain dihedrals
   - also possibly each 3-atom plane in dihedral and then put rotation bond along one axis, rotate +/- about that axis few degrees for training
   -- not clear how this would sample all conformations ... but it must, just without kinematics - but if just clock 1 degree or so at a time, or 1 degree if see gradient from 1 degree to 2 degrees; evaluate all positions then move
   - reading on torch7, tensorflows; nothing clear yet about architecture that would alllow separate output layers e.g. one for each class (because worry that bad for res X might be ok for res Y - e.g. gly - and output training only for res X).
   
30 nov 2015
   - for rotations of dihedral planes, add system to rotate back the next angle or two to minimse displacement of levered atom
   - also add statistics on each dihedral to (primarily) make it so don't adjust omega angles outside observed ranges
   
03 feb 2016
   - have been working on collect module, designing build
   - remember to run on fire !  installed lua-postgres with:
   luarocks install luadbi-postgresql POSTGRES_INCDIR=/usr/include/postgresql
   luarocks install luasql-postgres PGSQL_INCDIR=/usr/include/postgresql/
   - think lua on fire now talking to postgres on fire
   - wrote bin/rfsync on fire, uses unison
   -- not happy, new plan is:
   proj/rFold -- on fire, mount from nova
   proj/rFold-nova -- on nova, rfsync will unison here.

01 mar 2016
   - added routines to rtmDSSP to print internal coordinates for each residue to Cbeta (no side chain yet) -- bond lengths, angles, dihedrals.
   -- should now be able to read into db and then try to reproduce 3d coordinates -- all in DSSP output

02 mar 2016
   - work on lua parser for rtm dssp output with internal coordinates
   
03 mar 2016
   - finish up lua parser for rtm dssp output with internal coordinates
   - start on buildprot ...
   - install 'numeric lua', however not as documented or indicated in messages -- needed:
   -- luarocks make numlua-0.3-1.rockspec HDF5_INCDIR="/usr/include/hdf5/serial/" HDF5_LIBDIR="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial"
   -- oops had to fix numlua.h, add:
   #if LUA_VERSION_NUM <= 501
   +#define lua_number2int(i,n) ((i)=(int)(n))
   --- as per github
   
06 mar 2016
   - past few days on buildprot (bp1.lua)
   - seems straightforward porting of coordSpace work from past to now
   - changed dssp to putput O coordinates as well, but current work does not handle sidechains beyond cb

08 mar 2016
   - finished initial implementation bp1.c for backbone and c-beta; many positions work, some errors

09 mar 2016
   - cleared errors, all generated dihedrals match 4th atom to x.0e-05 -- not translated back to chain, so not cumulative

13 mar 2016
   - write but not test generation of side chain internal coordinates in rtmDSSP
   
18 mar 2016
   - re-work generation of side chain internal coordinates to fix compile errors, make more robust to missing atoms

21 mar 2016
   - get installation working on xub vm, ready for travels next week.

04 apr 2016
   - during travels only outlined algorithm for buildprot version 2 and studied OO implementations in Lua
   - installed and debugged Lumen for potential use in parallel processing (for buildprot)

05 apr 2016
   - initial implementation - just loading - bp2.lua, protein.lua

06 apr 2016
   - protein.lua importing bp1 steps

07 apr 2016
   - add redundant n-ca-cb hedron to rtm-dssp output because chi1 defined from N and defined all side chains using chi1 (could have used c-ca-cb already present)

12 apr 2016
   - reworking protein.lua a bit to place atom coordinates in dihedron objects
   - got to printing PDB atom records, but not yet assembling residues or chains from dihedrons

07 may 2016
   - can generate 1st residue (7rsa lys 1)  with correct coordinates starting from  n-ca-c coords from pdb file

08 may 2016
   - can generate all residues PDB for 7rsa and 1mud, currently only off by 0.001 on some axes for atoms in final residues
